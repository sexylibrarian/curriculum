# Entrepreneurship

### Projected Time
30-45 minutes

### Prerequisites

Enthusiasm & Passion for Your Project
Perseverance to see it Become a Product

### Motivation

You've identified a problem in the world that needs fixing. You believe your product will improve people's lives and fix this problem for them.

### Objective
**Students will be able to** do something that we'll list here:
- Sketch a MVP of their Product
- Land on a feasible Business Model for their Product
- Be ready to approach users of their product with testing questions
- Iterate and Improve on the Product before Development

### Specific Things To Teach
- Describe their product in 5 words, to two sentences
- Lo-fi wireframes (hand sketches)
- Hi-fidelity wireframes (created with Omnigraffle, Balsamiq or free Mockingbird)
- Common business models for startup products
	- Intro the Business Model Canvas and give a high level overview of how to complete
- Create sample user testing questions
	- A quick in-person user testing pairing exercise
- Lots of resources to getting your MVP into development

### Mini Lesson / Intro Summary

So you have an idea for a startup. Welcome to San Francisco!

Luckily there are many free resources to get your company off the ground, including the most valuable one: the fact that you are learning to code and will be able to build the early version of your product yourself.

Before you begin to blindly build something, it's important to know how your product will attract users, customers, and make money. Investors want to see a working prototype and some revenue, or what they call traction, before they consider making an investment. Investors will invest to help your business scale, or attract more customers, users and revenue through marketing, public relations, and community efforts.

In this lesson, you will learn how to describe your product so people will understand how it works in a few simple words. How will you make money and who will you charge? We'll cover some basic business models and see what works for you. We'll sketch out a sample design and do some user flows and create a development flow. Then we'll do some mock user testing, by creating a few sample questions you might ask a user of your product.

We'll also touch on where to go from here. From the NASDAQ Entrepreneurial Center to Women Who Code and Girls in Tech meetups, there are a plethora of workshops and panel disussions where you can network for mentors and advisors, and most of them are free.

### Mini Lesson / Describe Your MVP

Have an idea? Great! Don't have one yet? Just make one up for this lesson. You never know where it will take you.

Make sure to mention these things:
- MVP / Minimum Viable Product
	- This is a sub-thing describing what an MVP is
- Create a two-sentence description
- Create a five word description
- Pair up and exchange product descriptions. Give each other feedback and tweak your product descriptions as needed.


### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

Building too early is a common mistake. User testing with lo-fi prototypes allows you to test assumptions and iterate accordingly, saving you costly development time. 

This is something that students might not realize or might assume at first.

Make sure they avoid this: Creating an app and releasing it to the app store without users who have signed up or potential customers. It's so sad to see an app just languish in the app store, ignored and bored.


### Guided Practice

Have the students work with you as you do something: We'll do exercises for describing MVPs, sketching lo-fo versions of the products, and writing use testing questions and quizzing each other.


### Independent Practice

Class does this thing themselves with specific additional items: Student will receive a blank business model canvas and can fill out the model on their own.


### Challenge

Students can try to do this other thing: Report back with user testing results and how they shaped the next iteration of the product.


### Check for Understanding

Have students summarize to each other, make a cheat sheet, take a quiz, do an assignment, or something else that helps assess their understanding.
